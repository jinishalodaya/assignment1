		<h1>BOX 01</h1>
<p>You said that we would always be
            Without you I feel lost at sea
            Through the darkness you'd hide with me
            Like the wind we'd be wild and free
            You
            Said you'd follow me anywhere
            But your eyes
            Tell me you won't be there</p></div></div>

			<h1>BOX 02</h1>
<p>I got to learn how to love without you
               I got to carry my cross without you
               Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
               Figure it out without you
               And I'm done sitting home without you
               Fuck I'm going out without you
               I'm going to tear this city down without you
               I'm going Bonnie and Clyde without you</p></div>

			<h1>BOX03</h1>
<p>Now I'm running away my dear
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beating I can't see clear
How I'm wishing that you were here
You
Said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes
Tell me you won't be there</p></div>
